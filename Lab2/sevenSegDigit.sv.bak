		----------PART TWO----------
		Your logic to convert decimal number to the bits corresponding to a seven-seg goes here.
		4 bit input -> values from 0 to 15. We can only display 0 to 9 but you should still deal with cases where 10-15 are passed in. In this case, set it so the display is just blank.
		We reccomend a case statement. Make sure all of the cases have outputs assigned.
