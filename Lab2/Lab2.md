# Lab 2

## Description

Write drivers for a set of five seven segment displays and drive them through an example ALU which performs either addition or a bitshift based on a set of switches as inputs.

## Learned

Learned how to write rudimentary modules to interact with real pins and devices as well as program basic combinatorial logic.
